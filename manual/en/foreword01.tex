Whenever we meet someone we didn't know before, it is the first few seconds which decide whether or not we will like that person. And even more so if the person is somewhat, say, different. That is, if it somehow doesn't come up with our expectations of a normal person, be it for strange behaviour, the pink hair and torn jeans, a funny accent, or his/her stunning beauty. The first impression is always decisive.

Traverso, although not being a person, \emph{is} rather different from other computer programs, and if a user expects it to work just like any other program, it will most certainly cause a lot of frustration. In order to avoid disappointment and to make sure the first impression is positive, we encourage you to read at least the first chapter of this book, which explains the basic concept of the user interface. Difference can sometimes be a good thing, but you will have to learn a couple of new things right at the beginning, otherwise you will not even be able to play with the software and explore it on your own. But don't be put off, it only takes a couple of minutes to learn the basics, and after a few hours or days you will have internalized it and discover the power and efficiency by yourself. So please allow us to introduce you to a programme which is a bit different, but in a charming way\dots
