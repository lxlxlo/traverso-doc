There are several internet resources which can provide help if you struggle with Traverso. The best place to ask questions, get into contact with other users and the developers, or give feedback is the user forum on the Traverso homepage \cite{forum}. All users or people interested in our project are invited and encouraged to subscribe to the forum and help building up a community. The more feedback there is from the users, the better the developers can improve the usability and feature set.

\section{Getting involved}
The Traverso team highly appreciates any kind of contribution. If you are C++ coder, artist, musician, translator, or bug hunter who wants to help making Traverso the best multitrack application ever, please offer your help on the developer mailing list (traverso-devel@nongnu.org).
